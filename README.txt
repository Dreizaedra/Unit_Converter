A tool made to convert imperial units into metric ones and vice-versa.

For example it converts the user's input value from meters into feet, 
from feet into meters, the same goes for volume, mass and
their respective units.

This value is set to a baseline of 20 and will reset itself if the user 
tries to input 0 or a negative number (no other characters allowed either)
when clicking the convert button.

Look at 'Example.png' if you want to see what this tool looks like.

This is another of my small projects to practice front-end stuff. 
This time I experimented with the class constructor tool in JS to create my array.

I also decided not to use flexbox and instead tried to experiment 
with 'position: absolute;' settings in the CSS in order to learn to use it, 
and later on use both together whenever applicable and useful.
